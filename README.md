1. Lasso regression model
2. Neural Network Model

  The coefficients of estimated model tells that he Lasso regression model has some coefficients that are exactly equal to zero, 
    while the linear regression model has non-zero coefficients for all variables.It seems that Lasso is a useful method for feature selection as it can identify
    the most important variables and eliminate the irrelevant ones.
        Comparing the result of MSE for both Lasso  and Linear Regression, I can observe that adjusting the hyperparameter alpha to 0.1 ,the result has a lower mean squared error (MSE). 
    This indicates that 0.1 alpha of results may have better performance than the higher number of alpha.
